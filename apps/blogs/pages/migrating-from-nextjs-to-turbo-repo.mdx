description: Step by step guide to convert a NextJS app to a mono-repo using turbo-repo.
---

Recently, I wanted to convert my portfolio repository to a mono-repo using turbo-repo. I wanted to convert the NextJS app to turbo-repo so that I could build multiple apps in the same repo which can share packages among them.

You can check the starter source code here: [https://github.com/himohitmehta/himohit.me/tree/before-turbo-repo](https://github.com/himohitmehta/himohit.me/tree/before-turbo-repo), this is deployed to [himohit.me](himohit.me). After converting this to a mono-repo I can deploy the apps to:

-   [himohit.me](himohit.me)
-   [blogs.himohit.me](blogs.himohit.me)

## Why turbo?

[turbo](https://turbo.build/) is an incremental bundler and build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust.

It consists of 2 parts:

-   Turborepo: A CLI tool that runs on your machine and is responsible for building your project.
-   Turbopack: an incremental bundler (the successor to Webpack)

Jared Palmer, who is also the creator of Formik, built Turbo, and Vercel acquired it in 2021.

Iâ€™ve written this guide to help others convert their project into a mono repo.

## Let's begin:

Clone the repository [https://github.com/himohitmehta/himohit.me/tree/before-turbo-repo](https://github.com/himohitmehta/himohit.me/tree/before-turbo-repo) and install the dependencies using `pnpm install` and then run the application to check if everything is working fine, run the app using `pnpm dev`.
You should see something like this

Next Step:
Stop the server and continue

## Adding Turborepo

```bash copy
pnpm add turbo --global
```

the next step is to add `turbo.json` file in the root directory of the project:

```json copy
{
	"$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
	"pipeline": {
		"build": {
			"outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
		},
		"lint": {}
	}
}
```

We can now run `turbo dev` to run the app

```bash copy
turbo dev
```

If everything was successful, you should see a similar output:

## Convert the project to monorepo

To convert our single project to a monorepo, we need three steps:

1. Move our single app to an apps folder, where our web applications will be
2. Define our workspace by creating a package.json in the root folder
3. Create a packages folder. That's where we'll put our shared components and logic

### Move our single app to the `apps` folder

Run the following commands in the root folder of our project:

```bash copy
# create the directory
 mkdir -p ./apps/website

# move the directory
mv ./** ./.** ./apps/website
```

The error shown below is because the `git bash` is not running as an Administrator.

```bash
mv: cannot move './apps' to a subdirectory of itself, './apps/website/apps'
mv: cannot move './components' to './apps/website/components': Permission denied
mv: cannot move './node_modules' to './apps/website/node_modules': Permission denied
mv: cannot move './.git' to './apps/website/.git': Permission denied
mv: cannot move './.next' to './apps/website/.next': Permission denied
```

![Terminal screenshot](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m0cqx7sm3amlwbsgyh5r.png)

you might see the above error in Windows, to resolve this, run the `git bash` as an Administrator and close the current VS Code window.

Now you should see something like this.

The current folder structure will look like this:

![Folder structure](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8u870vmt4htu47tv7a55.png)

Now let's move back the .git folder, .gitignore and .turbo files

```bash copy
mv ./apps/website/.git ./apps/website/.gitignore ./apps/website/.turbo ./apps/website/turbo.json ./

```

The current folder structure looks like this:

![Folder structure](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zjusi050tc0xchylz1de.png)

## Create `package.json` in the root folder

```json copy
{
	"name": "himohit.me",
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"private": true,
	"packageManager": "pnpm@6.14.1",
	"scripts": {
		"dev": "turbo dev"
	}
}
```

### Add the workspace config:

**pnpm-workspace.yaml**

```yaml copy
packages:
    - "apps/*"
    - "packages/*"
```

## Create the `packages` folder:

Weâ€™d now want to create the packages folder to put our shared components in. Run this command to create it:

```bash copy
mkdir -p packages/ui/components
```

Run `pnpm init` inside the ui folder.

![create package](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3mxyhcp0l1j0ue5a5e1c.png)

We will continue working on this `ui` package later. For now, we will focus on building a `blogs` app using `Nextra`.

Let's create a new app in the apps folder by using the following command:

```bash copy
mkdir -p ./apps/blogs

# create `package.json`
pnpm init

# add the dependencies
pnpm add next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-blog

```

Create the following `next.config.js` file in your blogs directory:

```js copy
const withNextra = require("nextra")({
	theme: "nextra-theme-blog",
	themeConfig: "./theme.config.jsx",
});

module.exports = withNextra();

// If you have other Next.js configurations, you can pass them as the parameter:
// module.exports = withNextra({ /* other next.js config */ })
```

create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your blog's directory. This will be used to configure the Nextra Blog theme:

```jsx copy
export default {
	footer: <p>MIT 2023 Â© Nextra.</p>,
	head: ({ title, meta }) => (
		<>
			{meta.description && (
				<meta name="description" content={meta.description} />
			)}
			{meta.tag && <meta name="keywords" content={meta.tag} />}
			{meta.author && <meta name="author" content={meta.author} />}
		</>
	),
	readMore: "Read More â†’",
	postFooter: null,
	darkMode: false,
	navs: [
		{
			url: "https://github.com/shuding/nextra",
			name: "Nextra",
		},
	],
};
```

Inside `pages` create an `index.mdx` file with the content you want.

Update the `turbo.json` with the following:

```json copy
{
	"$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
	"globalDependencies": ["**/.env.*local"],
	"pipeline": {
		"build": {
			"dependsOn": ["^build"],
			"outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
		},
		"lint": {},
		"dev": {
			"cache": false,
			"persistent": true
		}
	}
}
```

If everything is fine: you should be able to see this in the terminal after running `pnpm dev`:

![Running the repo apps](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9uctdij2mgc17tbq3jpq.png)
Open the URL in the browser:
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Great it's working. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ you have successfully completed the migration.

The deployed link: [himohit.me](himohit.me)

> Note: Please Update the `.gitignore` file to ignore the `node_modules` and `.next` folder

**.gitignore**

```.gitignore copy
# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# dependencies
node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# testing
/coverage

# next.js
.next/
/out/

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem

# debug
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# local env files
.env*.local

# vercel
.vercel

# typescript
*.tsbuildinfo
next-env.d.ts
.turbo
```

## Bonus: Updating the Vercel deployment settings:

Go to `Project Settings` in Vercel dashboard:

![Project Settings in vercel](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b2iph1mvsf3jwbpk29iy.png)

Update the Build command to:

```bash copy
cd ../.. && turbo run build --filter={apps/website}...
```

and `Root Directory` to:

![Root Directory in vercel](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qhy3cf7ti6zns3u0lv9p.png)

Update the Website name inside the `apps/website` directory `package.json`, name to "website".

That's it, you have deployed your app on Vercel.

Thanks for your time. I hope this will be helpful to you guys.
